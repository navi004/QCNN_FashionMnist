# Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) with PennyLane and TensorFlow

This repository contains a project that implements a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) using PennyLane and TensorFlow. The project involves quantum preprocessing of images, followed by training a classical neural network to classify them.

## Project Structure

- **`Dataset`** : Fashion Mnist
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- PennyLane
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
- Google Colab (optional, if using Google Drive)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pennylane tensorflow matplotlib tqdm
```

## Quantum Preprocessing

The project uses a quantum circuit to process the input images. The images are preprocessed using a quantum variational circuit, where a 2x2 region of the image is fed into a quantum circuit, and the resulting quantum states are measured.

## Training the Model

The processed quantum images are then fed into a classical neural network model built using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of a simple dense network with a softmax output layer for classification.

### Training Details

- **Quantum Layer**: The quantum preprocessing is done using PennyLane, and the processed images are saved for later use.
- **Classical Model**: The model is a simple feedforward neural network with a softmax output layer.
- **Training & Validation**: The model is trained on both quantum-processed and classical images to compare their performance.

## Results

The notebook visualizes the accuracy and loss for both the quantum and classical models over multiple epochs. The comparison helps in understanding the potential benefits of incorporating quantum preprocessing into classical models.
